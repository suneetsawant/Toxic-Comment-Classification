# Toxic Comment Classification 

This repository is an attempt to develop a model for multilabel classification of Wikipedia toxic comments dataset which can be found on [Toxic Comments](https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge). 

The repository includes a jupyter notebook which includes detailed explanation of the model development. 

The model is developed and trained using Google's Colaboratory tool for which I am grateful to Google.
